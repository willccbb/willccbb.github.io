Hi! I'm a machine learning researcher based in New York City.<br><br>

I recently completed my PhD (CS) at Columbia, where I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Christos Papadimitriou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou) and [Tim Roughgarden](https://timroughgarden.org/).
I'll be (re)joining Morgan Stanley's [Machine Learning Research](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/technology/machine-learning-research-papers) group in August, where I interned over the past year.<br><br>

Before that, I was an undergrad (CS + philosophy) and masters (DS) student at Penn, and I've spent time in research and engineering roles at AWS, Two Sigma, MongoDB, and AmFam.
